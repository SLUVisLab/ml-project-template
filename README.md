# 🚀 ML Project Template

Welcome to the **ML Project Template**! 🎯 This repository is designed to **keep your project code organized** while providing **pre-written setup scripts** to help you run your project seamlessly across multiple environments:

- ✅ **Jupyter Notebook Server (GPU3)**
- ✅ **Local Code Editors (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)**
- ✅ **Google Colab**

Whether you are working on **data preprocessing, model training, or evaluation**, this template provides a structured workflow to streamline your ML experiments.

## 📂 Project Structure  
Here's a quick breakdown of the repository contents:

| **File / Directory** | **Purpose** |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `main.ipynb` | 📓 The main Jupyter Notebook for running experiments and prototyping ML code. |
| `README.md` | 📄 Documentation for understanding and using this template. |
| `.gitignore` | 🚫 Ensures that large files, logs, and unnecessary cache files are not committed to Git. |
| `requirements.txt` | 📦 Lists all required dependencies (for `pip install -r requirements.txt`). |

| **Folders** | **Purpose** |
|------------|-------------|
| `scripts/` | 🛠 Contains reusable Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation. |
| `results/` | 📊 Stores logs, metrics, and experiment outputs. |
| `models/` | 🏗 Stores trained models and checkpoints. |
| `data/` | 📁 Placeholder for datasets (**already in `.gitignore`**, so any datasets added here won’t be committed to Git). |
